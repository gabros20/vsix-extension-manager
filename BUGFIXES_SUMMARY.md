# Bug Fixes Summary - Interactive Mode Issues

**Date**: 2024  
**Total Bugs Fixed**: 2  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL FIXED

---

## Overview

Fixed two critical bugs in the interactive mode that were blocking normal usage:

1. ‚úÖ **Interactive Remove Command** - "Editor is required" error
2. ‚úÖ **Setup Wizard Loop** - Wizard appears on every launch

Both issues have been identified, fixed, tested, and documented.

## Bug #1: Interactive Remove Command Failure

### Problem

When removing an extension through the interactive menu, users with multiple editors encountered:

```
‚ñ†  Command failed: Editor is required but not provided.
‚îÇ  In auto-confirm mode, you must specify --editor flag.
```

### Root Cause

The interactive menu was passing `yes: true` to skip double-confirmation but **not providing the editor selection**. When multiple editors were installed, the remove command couldn't prompt for editor selection because auto-confirm mode disabled all prompts.

### Solution

Modified `handleRemoveExtensions()` to:

1. Detect available editors upfront
2. Let user select editor before entering extension ID
3. Pass selected editor along with `yes: true` to remove command

### Files Changed

- `src/commands/interactive.ts` (+28 lines)

### Impact

- **Severity**: High (Blocked basic functionality)
- **Affected Users**: All users with multiple editors (VS Code + Cursor)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and tested

**Documentation**: `BUGFIX_INTERACTIVE_REMOVE.md`

## Bug #2: Setup Wizard Running on Every Launch

### Problem

After completing the setup wizard, it would reappear on every subsequent CLI launch:

```bash
$ vsix
‚îÇ  üëã Welcome to VSIX Extension Manager v2.0!
‚îÇ  Would you like to run the setup wizard?  # Appears EVERY time!
```

### Root Cause

**Filename mismatch** between what the wizard saved and what the loader searched for:

- **Wizard saved**: `~/.vsix/config.yml`
- **Loader searched for**: `vsix.config.yml`, `.vsix.yml`, etc. (but NOT `config.yml`)

The wizard created a file the loader couldn't find, so every run was detected as "first run".

### Solution

Changed wizard to save config as `vsix.config.yml` instead of `config.yml`, matching the loader's search pattern.

### Files Changed

- `src/core/setup/wizard.ts` (2 lines)
  - Updated `getConfigPath()` method
  - Updated UI prompt text

### Migration

For existing users with `~/.vsix/config.yml`:

```bash
mv ~/.vsix/config.yml ~/.vsix/vsix.config.yml
```

### Impact

- **Severity**: High (Annoying UX, blocked normal usage)
- **Affected Users**: All users who completed setup wizard
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and tested

**Documentation**: `BUGFIX_SETUP_WIZARD.md`

## Testing Results

### Automated Tests

```bash
‚úÖ npm run lint   - 0 errors
‚úÖ npm run build  - Compilation successful
```

### Manual Testing

1. ‚úÖ Setup wizard completes and saves config
2. ‚úÖ Config is detected on subsequent runs
3. ‚úÖ Remove command works with single editor
4. ‚úÖ Remove command prompts for editor with multiple editors
5. ‚úÖ All interactive menu flows work correctly

### Files Verified

```bash
$ ls -la ~/.vsix/
vsix.config.yml     # ‚úÖ Correct filename
update-cache.json   # ‚úÖ Cache working
```

## Prevention Strategies

### For Similar Issues

1. **Integration Tests**
   - Test config save ‚Üí load round-trip
   - Test interactive flows end-to-end
   - Mock multiple editor scenarios

2. **Consistent Naming**
   - Define filename constants in central location
   - Use constants everywhere (save, load, UI)
   - Document file naming conventions

3. **Better Error Messages**
   - Add debug logging for config file search
   - Show which files are being checked
   - Suggest fixes when config not found

4. **Code Review Checklist**
   - Verify interactive mode passes correct options
   - Check that saved files match search patterns
   - Test with multiple editor configurations

### Recommended Improvements

```typescript
// Centralize config filenames
// src/config/constants.ts
export const CONFIG_FILENAMES = {
  HOME: "vsix.config.yml",
  PROJECT: ".vsix.yml",
  LEGACY: [".vsixrc", ".vsixrc.json"],
} as const;

// Use in wizard and loader
import { CONFIG_FILENAMES } from "./constants";

// wizard.ts
return path.join(homeDir, ".vsix", CONFIG_FILENAMES.HOME);

// schemaV2.ts
export const CONFIG_V2_FILE_NAMES = [
  CONFIG_FILENAMES.PROJECT,
  CONFIG_FILENAMES.HOME,
  ...CONFIG_FILENAMES.LEGACY,
];
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **File Operations** - Always verify save/load use same filenames
2. **Interactive Mode** - Pass all required options to commands
3. **Auto-confirm** - Ensure required prompts happen before setting `yes: true`
4. **Testing** - Manual testing of interactive flows is critical
5. **Documentation** - Config file locations should be clearly documented

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. ‚úÖ Deploy fixes to production
2. üìã Update user documentation with config file locations
3. üìã Add migration notice in CHANGELOG

### Short-term

1. Add integration tests for interactive mode
2. Add config file round-trip tests
3. Improve error messages for missing config

### Long-term

1. Implement auto-migration for old config files
2. Add `vsix config` command to show/edit config
3. Add config validation on startup
