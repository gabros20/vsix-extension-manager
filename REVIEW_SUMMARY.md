# Code Review Session Summary

**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Files Reviewed:** 92 TypeScript files  
**Branch:** `feat/v2.0-refactor`  
**Commit:** `39971b7`

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

✅ **Review entire `/src` codebase** for:
- Bugs and potential runtime issues
- Dead code and unused functions
- References to old/legacy code
- Monkey patching or anti-patterns
- Code clarity and coherence

## 📊 Results

### Overall Assessment
**Score: 4.8/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

The codebase is **production-ready** with high code quality. Clean architecture, consistent patterns, strong typing, and no critical issues.

### Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Dead Code (FIXED)** ✅
   - Removed `withV2CommandHandling` function (73 unused lines)
   - Location: `src/index.ts`
   - Impact: Reduced code bloat

2. **Incomplete Feature (FIXED)** ✅
   - Implemented doctor `--fix` in interactive mode
   - Location: `src/commands/interactive.ts`
   - Impact: Feature now works as expected

3. **Missing Type (FIXED)** ✅
   - Added `fix?: boolean` to GlobalOptions interface
   - Location: `src/commands/base/types.ts`
   - Impact: Type safety maintained

### Technical Debt (Acceptable)

**Low Priority Issues:**
- 80 ESLint warnings (unused variables, `any` types)
- Type safety in `planGenerator.ts` (uses `any` for services)
- Type safety in `formatters.ts` (uses `any[]` parameters)

**Status:** Documented in CODE_REVIEW.md as post-v2.0 cleanup tasks
