## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Conventional Commits** for commit messages

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

- `feat: add support for OpenVSX marketplace`
- `fix: resolve download timeout issues`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `refactor: improve error handling in downloader`

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful type names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Handle all possible error cases

### Error Handling

- Use descriptive error messages
- Include context when possible
- Log errors appropriately
- Provide actionable feedback to users

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
